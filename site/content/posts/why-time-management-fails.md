There are hundreds of time- and task-management methodologies, techniques and
pracices out there, and new ones get invented, flourish and fade into obscurity
regularely. Why can't we just stick to one of them and stop rehashing the same
ideas?

I have jumped from one method to another a fair amount of times, and finally
settled on a hybrid of [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)
and [Lights spreadsheet](https://www.ultraworking.com/lights/) with a healthy
dose of [The Checklist
Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) thrown in.

The fact that I had to combine three different systems (including one claiming
universality) in order to get a working setup might give a clue: are we
oversimplifying things?

if you look at lists like [Best Time Management
Techniques](https://clockify.me/time-management-techniques), you'll notice that
every technique or method has an area of applicability, and cannot be used as a
fully featured system with no need of supplemental ones.

This is actually a problem:

- One might not understand the need for supplemental systems, and endlessly jump
  between methods not being aware that they are not full, especially if they are
  marketed as all-encompassing;
- Separate systems are usually supported by separate pieces of software, with
  all the corresponding pain;
- Separate systems can easily produce a compartmentalization of thinking that
  makes it harder to treat one's tasks as a whole, and nudges one to deal with
  sets of tasks in every system in isolation from the rest.

The goal of this project is to produce a single cohesive time-management system
that covers all the aspects of life (this is the aspiration behind GTD, however
it fails to cover several significant areas). I believe that the amount of
complexity to be tamed necessitates a software solution with a very well
throught-out UX, otherwise the learning curve will be too steep.

In next posts I plan to elaborate on areas where existing systems fail, and how
they could be amended (not replaced!) in order to be brought together into a
coherent whole.
