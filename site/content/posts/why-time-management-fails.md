There are hundreds of time- and task-management methodologies, techniques and
pratcices out there, and new ones get invented, flourish and fade into obscurity
regularely. Why can't we just stick to one of them and stop rehashing the same
old ideas, differently packaged?

I have jumped from one method to another a fair amount of times, and finally
settled on a hybrid of (GTD)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done]
and (Lights spreadsheet)[https://www.ultraworking.com/lights/] with a healthy
dose of (The Checklist
Manifesto)[http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/] thrown in.

The fact that I had to combine three different systems (including one claiming
universality) in order to get a working setup might give a clue: are we
oversimplifying things?

if you look at lists like (Best Time Management
Techniques)[https://clockify.me/time-management-techniques], you'll notice that
every technique or method has an area of applicability, and cannot be used as a
fully featured system with no need of supplemental ones.

Why having several systems is actively hurting (and actually is making things
more complicated than they should be)?

- One might not understand the need for supplemental systems, and endlessly jump
  between methods not being aware that they are not full;
- Several systems are usually supported by separate pieces of software, with all
  the corresponding pain;
- Different systems can easily induce a compartmentalization of thinking that
  makes it harder to treat one's tasks as a whole, and nudges one to deal with
  each system separately.

The goal of this project is to produce a single cohesive time-management system
that both covers all the aspects of life (this is the aspiration behind GTD,
however it fails to cover several significant areas). I believe that the amount
of complexity to be tamed necessitates a software solution with a very well
throught-out UX, otherwise the learning curve will be too steep.

In next posts I plan to elaborate on areas where existing systems fail, and how
they could be amended (not replaced!) in order to be brought together into a
coherent whole.
